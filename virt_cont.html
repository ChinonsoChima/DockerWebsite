            <h2>What is Virtualization?</h2><br><br>
            <p>It is a general approach for getting out of in-house hardware assets. In the beginning, this technique was a revelation
                because it allowed developers to run multiple OS(Operating system) in different VMs (virtuals machines) all running on
                the same host. This dissolved the need for extra hardware resources. </p><br>

            <h2>What is Containerization?</h2><br><br>
            <p>Containerization is a strategy of bringing Virtualization to the OS-level. Though Virtualization is an abstraction to the hardware, containerization brings
                abstraction of OS. Containerization is more efficient because there is no guest OS to utilize a hostâ€™s OS and
                do not have to share relevant libraries and resources, unlike virtual machines. Containers works on bare-metal systems, cloud instances, and virtual machines,
                across Linux, Windows, and Mac.
                Containerization is a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization that involves encapsulating an application in a container with its OS.
                Containerization boots up in a fraction of seconds; this is
                because Container shares host OS and holds only those application which is related to binaries and libraries. </p><br>

            <h2>How Do They Compare?</h2><br><br>
		<p>Many containers can exist at the same time in a system-like orchestration. Containers are currently only of Linux format(Even Windows requires WSL, Windows Subsystem for Linux); Virtual machines can be of any operating system yet
they're not as portable as containers due to the large filesizes of imported/exported virtual machine images. Containers allow a way to run numerous workloads within the instance of an operating system; 
Virtual machines emulate hardware, allocating resources in accordance to the user's specifications which will affect the performance of the virtual machine, making containers more ideal for lightweight development environments because they require much less hard drive space, memory, and are packaged with the necessary dependencies. 
However, when it comes to security, virtual machines are safer since they don't share the operating system with the host machine. Although a VM can share resources with the host machine, they generally don't by default and it's an option, unlike containers which can be considered an attack vector.
